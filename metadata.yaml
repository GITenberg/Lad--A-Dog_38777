description: 'American author and respected dog breeder Albert Payson Terhune was
  so enamored of his handsome, loyal collie Lad that he was inspired to feature the
  furry fellow in a series of short stories. Originally published in magazines, the
  Lad stories became so popular that they took on a life of their own. Lad: A Dog,
  the first collection of Terhune''s Lad tales, is sure to please dog lovers of all
  ages.'
